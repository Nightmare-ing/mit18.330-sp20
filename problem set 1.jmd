# 18.330 Problem set 1 (spring 2020)

## Submission deadline: 11:59pm on Monday, February 10

The questions are a mixture of hand / analytical calculation
and numerical calculation using Julia. You should submit a PDF file.
You may photograph / scan your handwritten solutions for the theory parts,
or (preferably) type them up as part of a Jupyter notebook that you print to PDF.

### Exercise 1: Evaluating polynomials

Consider the polynomial function

$$
p(a, x) = a_0 + a_1 x + \cdots + a_n x^n
$$

**Problem 1:**

Write a function `poly_eval(a, x)` to evaluate $p(a, x)$ in the naive way by just summing the terms
as written. This should accept the coefficients $a_0, \ldots, a_n$ as a vector.

**Answer:**

```julia
function p(a, x)
    sum = 0.0
   for (index, a_item) in pairs(a)
        sum += a_item * x^(index - 1)
    end
    return sum
end

a = [1, 2, 3, 4]
x = 0.5
p(a, x)
```

**Problem 2:**

The **Horner method** is an alternative evaluation algorithm in which no
powers of $x$ are (explicitly) calculated.

For example, for a quadratic
$p(x) = a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0$ we have
$p(x) = a_0 + x(a_1 + a_2 x)$

Generalise this to polynomials of degree $3$ and then degree $n$

**Answer:**

For polynomials of degree $3$,

$$
p(x) = a_0 + x[a_1 + x(a_2 + a_3x)]
$$

For polynomials of degree $n$

$$
p(x) = a_0 + x(a_1 + x(a_2 + x(a_3 + x(\cdots + x(a_{n-1} + a_n x)))))
$$

**Problem 3:**

Implement this as a function `horner(a, x)`.

**Answer:**

Express the formula in a more uniform way

$$
p(x) = a_0 + x(a_1 + x(a_2 + x(a_3 + x(\cdots + x(a_{n-1} + x(a_n + 0))))))
$$

Then we can use for-loop to calculate this easily

```julia
function horner(a, x)
    res = 0.0
    for a_item in Iterators.reverse(a)
        res = a_item + x * res
    end
    return res
end

horner(a, x)
```

**Problem 4:**

Test `horner` to make sure it gives the same result as `poly_eval`.

**Answer:**

```julia
for x in 0:0.01:10
    horner_res = horner(a, x)
    p_res = p(a, x)
    if !isapprox(horner_res, p_res)
        error("Different result! Horner result is: $(horner_res), p res is: $(p_res)")
    end
end
println("Same Results in 0:0.01:10")
```

**Problem 5:**

Benchmark the two methods to evaluate the polynomial $p(a, x) = 1 + 2x + 3x^2 + \cdots + 10x^{10}$.
Which algorithm is more efficient and by how much?

**Answer:**

```julia
using BenchmarkTools
a = collect(1:10)
b_hor = @benchmark horner(a, 1)
b_p = @benchmark p(a, 1)
println("Horner: ", minimum(b_hor).time)
println("Naive: ", minimum(b_p).time)
```

The Horner method is more efficient by almost a half

**Problem 6:**

Count (approximately) the number of operations required by each of the two algorithms.
Does this agree with your benchmarks? (Feel free to perform more benchmarks to check this, e.g. using polynomials with random coefficients.)

**Answer:**

With the naive way, for each item in the vector `a`, we have to do summation and multiplication,
the number of multiplacation depends on the order.
Thus the number of operations required is

$$
1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + (n + 1) = \frac{(n + 2)(n + 1)}{2} = \Theta(n^2)
$$

Or maybe power computation is of order $\Theta(log n)$

With the Horner method, for each item we just have to do one multiplication and summation.
Thus the number of operations required is

$$
\Theta(n) = n
$$

To check this, consider `a` which has large enough length

```julia
using Plots

function run_times(f, a_maxlen, x)
    res_vec = []
    for len in 1:a_maxlen
        a = collect(1:len)
        b = @benchmark $f($a, $x)
        push!(res_vec, minimum(b).time)
    end
    return res_vec
end

a_maxlen = 10
x = 0.5
p_vec = run_times(p, a_maxlen, x)
horner_vec = run_times(horner, a_maxlen, x)

scatter(p_vec, label="Naive Method", xlabel="Length of a", ylabel="time (ns)")
scatter!(horner_vec, label="Horner Method")
```

### Exercise 2: Calculating $\sqrt{y}$

The Babylonian algorithm for calculating $x = \sqrt{y}$ is the following iteration:

$$
x_{n+1} = \frac{1}{2} \left( x_n + \frac{y}{x_n} \right)
$$

**Problem 1:**

_Suppose_ that $x_n$ converges to some limiting value $x^*$ as $n \to \infty$. Show that
then we must have $x^* = \sqrt{y}$.

**Answer:**

$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} x_{n + 1} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{1}{2} (x_n + \frac{y}{x_n})
$$

Because

$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} x_{n + 1} = \lim_{n \to \infty} x_{n} = x^*
$$

then

$$
x^* = \frac{1}{2} (x^* + \frac{y}{x^*}) \implies x^* = \sqrt{y}
$$

**Problem 2:**

To show that it does, in fact, converge, suppose (without loss of generality) that $x_0 < \sqrt{y}$.

Show that we then have $x_n < x_{n+1} < y$ for all $n$. Hence the $x_n$ form an increasing sequence that is bounded above, and hence they converge.
(This is a [theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotone_convergence_theorem) that we will just assume for this course.)

**Answer:**

If $x_n > \sqrt{y}$, then

$$
x_{n + 1} = \frac{1}{2}(\frac{y}{x_n} + x_n) > \sqrt{y}
$$

We know $x_0 < \sqrt{y}$, then

$$
x_1 = \frac{1}{2}(\frac{y}{x_0} + x_0) > \sqrt{y}
$$

Then $x_n > \sqrt{y}$ for $n \geq 2$. Consider

$$
x_{n + 1} - x_n = \frac{1}{2} (\frac{y}{x_n} - x_n) < 0 \implies x_{n + 1} < x_n
$$

Thus $\sqrt{y} < x_{n + 1} < x_n$, and $x_n$ converges.

So there's an error in the problem, $x_n$ decreases since $n \geq 2$, but always greater than $\sqrt{y}$

**Problem 3:**

Write a function `babylon` that implements this algorithm. It takes a tolerance $\epsilon$ and iterates
until the residual is $< \epsilon$. It should return the sequence $(x_n)$.

**Answer:**

```julia
function babylon(y, ϵ)
    xs = [Float64(y)]
    while true
        x_curr = 1 / 2 * (xs[end] + y / xs[end])
        if abs(x_curr - xs[end]) < ϵ
            break
        end
        push!(xs, x_curr)
    end
    return xs
end
```

**Problem 4:**

Test your function to make sure it gives the correct result.

**Answer:**

```julia
passFlag = true
for i in 1:20
    if !isapprox(sqrt(i), babylon(i, 1e-6)[end], atol=1e-6)
        error("Failed test with $(i): $(sqrt(i)), $(babylon(i, 1e-5)[end])")
        passFlag = false
        break
    end
end

if passFlag
    println("PASS ALL TESTS!")
end
```

**Problem 5:**

Use rational initial values to convince yourself that calculating with rationals is a bad idea
and that floating point is a good compromise.

**Answer:**

```julia
function rationalBabylon(y, ϵ)
    xs = [y]
    while true
        x_curr = 1 / 2 * (xs[end] + y / xs[end])
        if abs(x_curr - xs[end]) < ϵ
            break
        end
        push!(xs, x_curr)
    end
    return xs
end

rationalBabylon(3 // 4, 1e-2)
```

**Problem 6:**

For rational initial values, we can only reach $1 \times 10^{-2}$, if we reach precision $1 \times 10^{-3}$, we'll get overflow error.

Let $\delta_n := x_n - x^{*}$ be the distance of $x_n$ from the limiting value $\sqrt{y}$. (You may use Julia's built-in `sqrt` function, or take the last data value as the limit.)

Plot the (absolute value of) $\delta_n$ as a function of $n$ on a suitable combination of linear and log scales. How fast does it seem to be converging?

**Answer:**

```julia
y = 2
δ_n = abs.(babylon(y, 1e-10) .- sqrt(y))
p1 = scatter(δ_n)
p2 = scatter(δ_n, yscale=:log10)
plot(p1, p2, layout=(1, 2))
```

It seems to converge with

$$
\log_{10}\delta_n = a x^2 + bx + c \implies \delta_n = e^{Ax^2 + Bx + C}
$$

**Problem 7:**

Compare this on the same plot to the bisection algorithm from class. Which is better?

This one is better, because in the log scale, the bisection algorithm converges at a linear scale.
For Babylon algorithm, it converges at a quadratic scale.

**Problem 8:**

With $\delta_n$ defined as in Problem 6, show that $\delta_{n+1} \simeq \delta_n^2$ ($\simeq$ means "is approximately equal to").

Hint: you may need to use a Taylor series expansion; if so you should calculate this (by hand).

Replace $x_n$ and $x_{n + 1}$ in the iteration with the following formula

$$
x_n = \delta_n + x^*
$$

Then

$$
\delta_{n + 1} + x^* = \frac{1}{2}\left(\delta_n + x^* + \frac{y}{\delta_n + x^*}\right)
$$

We know $x^* = \sqrt{y}$, thus

$$
\begin{align*}
\delta_{n + 1} + x^* = \frac{1}{2}\left(\delta_n + x^* + \frac{x^{*2}}{\delta_n + x^*}\right) \\
\delta_{n + 1} = \frac{1}{2} \left(\delta_n - x^* + \frac{x^{*2}}{\delta_n + x^*}\right) \\
\implies \delta_{n + 1} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{\delta_n^2}{\delta_n + x^*}
\end{align*}
$$

As $n \to \infty$, $\delta_n \to 0$, thus

$$
\delta_{n + 1} = \frac{1}{2x^*} \delta_n^2 \implies \delta_{n + 1} \simeq \delta_n^2
$$

#### Exercise 3: Collision of two discs

[In this question we will finally find an actual use case for solving a
quadratic equation!]

Suppose we have two discs located at positions $\mathbf{x}_1$
and $\mathbf{x}_2$, with velocities $\mathbf{v}_1$ and $\mathbf{v}_2$,
respectively. The discs each have radius $r$.

1. Find an expression for the condition that the discs collide (i.e. are touching)
   at time $t$, involving the distance between their centres.

2. Rewrite your expression from [1.] as a quadratic equation for the time $t$.
   How many real solutions may this equation have?
   What do different numbers of solutions of this equation correspond to physically?

3. Write a function `collision` that takes all the data and calculates the
   collision time by using the quadratic formula.
   Make sure you take account of the answer to [2.]

4. Check that your code works by setting up some combinations of discs
   where you can do the calculation by hand (e.g. both discs moving
   at a 45-degree angle).

#### Exercise 4: Evaluating elementary functions

1. Implement the degree-$N$ Taylor polynomial approximation $\exp_N(x)$
   for $\exp(x)$ around $x=0$.
   Make sure that you do _not_ explicitly calculate factorials in your code.

2. Make an interactive visualization using the `Interact.jl` package,
   showing $\exp_N$ and $\exp$ as $N$ varies.

3. Make another visualization showing the **truncation error**, i.e. $\exp(x) - \exp_N(x)$.
   How does it behave?

4. Calculate a bound for the truncation error using the Lagrange remainder.
   Use [Stirling's approximation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling%27s_approximation)
   to estimate how many terms you need to take for the error to be of a certain size
   $\epsilon$.

5. Implement **range reduction** for the exponential function: instead of blindly applying
   a Taylor expansion (which will require many terms for large $x$),
   calculate $\exp(x)$ by reducing to the calculation of $\exp(r)$ for $r \in [-0.5, 0.5]$
   using the relation

$$\exp(2x) = \exp(x)^2.$$

6. Make an interactive visualization of the Taylor polynomial approximation to
   $\log(1+x)$, showing visually that it fails outside a certain interval. Which
   interval is that, and why?

#### Exercise 5: Exactly representing irrationals using symbolic computing

Here we will represent certain real numbers in the computer
_exactly_. Effectively we will use a type of _symbolic_ computation, in which we explicitly keep
the symbol $\sqrt{2}$, rather than approximating it by a floating-point number.

(Although this is not really the subject of the course, it's useful to remember
that there is a whole world of symbolic computation that can be applied to
certain problems, and that with a bit of work you often _do not need_ an expensive
commercial tool to do this!)

Consider the subset of the real numbers given by $S := \{a + b\sqrt{2}: a, b \in \mathbb{Q} \}$,
i.e. the set of numbers of the form $a + b\sqrt{2}$ where $a$ and $b$ are rational.

1. Write down formulae for the sum, difference and product of $a_1 + b_1\sqrt{2}$
   and $a_2 + b_2 \sqrt{2}$, showing that the results are in $S$.

2. Show that $1 / (a + \sqrt{b})$ is also in $S$ by supposing that it
   equals $c + d \sqrt{2}$ and finding explicit equations for $c$ and $d$.
   What type of equations are they? Solve them to find explicit values for $c$ and $d$
   in terms of $a$ and $b$.

   [This shows that we can also do division (by non-zero elements) and remain
   within the set, i.e. that $S$ is a **field**, namely an **extension field** of
   $\mathbb{Q}$. ]

3. Define a type `FieldExtension` to represent these number pairs, and
   the corresponding operations. Also define a `show` method to print them nicely
   using a `√` symbol (typed as `\sqrt<TAB>`).

4. [Extra credit]: What happens if you adjoin $\sqrt{2}$ and $\sqrt{3}$?
   Find formulae to represent $1 / (1 + \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3})$ as elements of the
   corresponding set.

## Some Julia tips

### Package installation

A package such as `BenchmarkTools` may be installed
by running the following code a _single_ time (only once in your
current Julia installation):

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("BenchmarkTools")
```

Load the package in each Julia session with

```julia
using BenchmarkTools
```

### Benchmarking

Simple benchmarking (i.e. timing how long an operation takes) may be done using the
`@time` macro:

    ```julia
    @time f(x)
    ```

However, if the time taken is too short then this is not accurate.
Instead, use the `BenchmarkTools.jl` package, with the syntax

    ```julia
    using BenchmarkTools

    @btime f(1, $x)
    ```

Note that any variables you pass in must be given `$` signs like this.

### Plotting

The `Plots.jl` package is used as follows after loading it with `using Plots`:

- `plot(x, y)`: plots the data with given $x$ coordinates and $y$ coordinates,
  joining those points with lines.
  These should be vectors.

- `plot(y)`: specifying only one argument plots the data against the numbers $1, 2, \ldots$

- `plot(-1:0.1:1, f)`: you may pass in a range and a function instead of data.

- `plot!`: adding `!` adds a new plot to an existing one.

- `scatter`: plots points instead of lines

- Add `yscale=:log10` inside the plotting command to use a logarithmic scale
  on the $y$ axis.

Note that there are small delays when first loading the package and for the first plot.
Later plots will be quick.

### Interactivity

The `Interact.jl` package enables us to generate simple interactive visualizations
using a slider (and some other "widgets").

To generate a single slider, wrap a `for` loop in the `@manipulate` macro, e.g.

```julia
@manipulate for i in 1:10
    i^2
end
```

To manipulate a plot, put a plot as the result at the end of the `for` loop:

```julia
@manipulate for i in 1:10
    plot(-5:0.01:5, x -> sin(i * x))
end
```

You can generate multiple sliders by using a joint `for` loop:

```julia
@manipulate for i in 1:10, j in 0.1:0.1:0.9
    i + j
end
```
